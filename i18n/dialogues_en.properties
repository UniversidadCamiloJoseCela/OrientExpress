scene2.line4.speaker=Narrator
scene2.line4.text=That individual is none other than Paco Fiestas, mayor of VillaNadie.
scene2.line5.speaker=Narrator
scene2.line5.text=His impeccable attire and body language betray a narcissistic and manipulative personality.

scene3.line11.text=You have the profile of the men I met on campaign: secretive, solitary. Where do you come from, Bob?
scene3.line12.speaker=Bob
scene3.line12.text=From many places. I have no story to tell.

scene4.line5.speaker=Narrator
scene4.line5.text=Juan Carlos serves himself a modest breakfast and sits a short distance from Poirot.
scene4.line6.speaker=Narrator

# SCENE 5
scene5.line1.speaker=Narrator
scene5.line1.text=The detective, true to his style, wastes no time exploiting the moment.

scene5.line3.speaker=Narrator
scene5.line3.text=Thus begins a dialogue between two men marked by the past, one by living it, the other by unraveling it.

# SCENE 5A
scene5a.line1.speaker=Poirot
scene5a.line1.text=Colonel, I would appreciate it if you could share your experience… Nadiekistan is a dark chapter in history. What kind of training did you receive?
scene5a.line2.speaker=Juan Carlos
scene5a.line2.text=Special forces. Infiltration tactics, assassination, immobilization without leaving a trace. Why so much curiosity, detective?
scene5a.line3.speaker=Poirot
scene5a.line3.text=Let’s say a crime can masquerade as an accident… and knowing how one can paralyze or render another unconscious without visible wounds is, let’s say, useful.
scene5a.line4.speaker=Juan Carlos
scene5a.line4.text=I understand. Yes, we learned to immobilize by applying pressure to key points. A man can fall without a single mark.
scene5a.line5.speaker=Poirot
scene5a.line5.text=And do you recall a boy? One you rescued in a subway, abandoned.
scene5a.line6.speaker=Juan Carlos
scene5a.line6.text=Of course. That boy… was Paco. I never imagined he would get this far. I always suspected he wasn’t unscathed by that childhood.

# SCENE 5B
scene5b.line1.speaker=Poirot
scene5b.line1.text=Colonel Juan Carlos, I wonder what the most intense days in Nadiekistan were like. Were there particularly complex situations?
scene5b.line2.speaker=Juan Carlos
scene5b.line2.text=Too many. But one especially marked me: we had to deactivate a bomb placed beneath an improvised hospital. We had less than five minutes.
scene5b.line3.speaker=Poirot
scene5b.line3.text=And you succeeded?
scene5b.line4.speaker=Juan Carlos
scene5b.line4.text=Yes. Not without losing two men in the operation… but we saved all the wounded. Nobody wrote about it.
scene5b.line5.speaker=Poirot
scene5b.line5.text=They also told me about a boy… rescued from a subway. Is that right?
scene5b.line6.speaker=Juan Carlos
scene5b.line6.text=That’s correct. I never knew what became of him. I would have liked to see him grow… and know he became something great. You say that is Paco Fiestas? Interesting…

# SCENE 6
scene6.line1.speaker=Narrator
scene6.line1.text=After the conversation with Commander Juan Carlos, Poirot briefly retires to his cabin, where he jots down some reflections in his pocket notebook.
scene6.line2.speaker=Narrator
scene6.line2.text=The talk left him more questions than answers, especially regarding the shared past with a boy rescued during the war… a boy who today holds a position of power as mayor.
scene6.line3.speaker=Narrator
scene6.line3.text=The train continues its journey through heavier snowfall, forcing a reduction in speed.
scene6.line4.speaker=Narrator
scene6.line4.text=Although there is no official reason for alarm yet, the tension in the air seems to grow, fueled by forced confinement and subtle differences among passengers.
scene6.line5.speaker=Narrator
scene6.line5.text=Lunch proceeds with a certain normality. Robin chats animatedly with Anne, while María remains distant, absorbed in a small notebook.
scene6.line6.speaker=Narrator
scene6.line6.text=As usual, Paco Fiestas takes one of the table’s heads, distributing smiles that not everyone returns.
scene6.line7.speaker=Narrator
scene6.line7.text=Meanwhile, in the locomotive, Louis and Bob are forced to remain at their posts.

scene6.line11.speaker=Narrator
scene6.line11.text=Steaming tea, sweet pastries, and a restrained silence.
scene6.line12.speaker=Narrator
scene6.line12.text=The detective watches closely and, with his characteristic elegance, approaches Paco Fiestas, who is absently thumbing through a crumpled newspaper.

# SCENE 7

scene7.line1.text=Following his chat with Commander Juan Carlos, Poirot withdraws briefly to his cabin to record some reflections in his pocket notebook.
scene7.line2.speaker=Narrator

scene7.line3.speaker=Narrator
scene7.line3.text=The train presses on through denser snowfall, forcing it to slow.
scene7.line4.speaker=Narrator
scene7.line4.text=Though there’s no official alarm yet, tension grows in the confined space, heightened by subtle divisions among the passengers.

scene7.line5.text=Lunch carries on fairly normally. Robin chats animatedly with Anne, while María sits apart, absorbed in her little notepad.
scene7.line6.speaker=Narrator
scene7.line6.text=As usual, Paco Fiestas occupies one of the table heads, offering smiles that not everyone returns.
scene7.line7.speaker=Narrator
scene7.line7.text=Meanwhile, in the locomotive, Louis and Bob remain at their posts.
scene7.line8.speaker=Narrator
scene7.line8.text=The storm’s fury has reduced visibility, and though the train keeps moving, its rhythm has notably slowed.
scene7.line9.speaker=Narrator
scene7.line9.text=They eat in quick shifts, watchful for any sign of complication.

scene7.line10.text=At half past four, Poirot returns to the lounge car where tea and pastries await.

scene7.line11.text=Steaming tea, sweet cakes, and a hushed quiet.
scene7.line12.speaker=Narrator
scene7.line12.text=The detective observes intently and, with his usual grace, approaches Paco Fiestas, who is flicking through a rumpled newspaper.

# SCENE 8
scene8.line1.speaker=Poirot
scene8.line1.text=Mr. Fiestas, would you do me the honor of joining me for a cup of tea? There is some history I wish to discuss with you…
scene8.line2.speaker=Narrator
scene8.line2.text=Paco regards him with a half-smile, raises his right eyebrow, and after a few seconds of feigned reflection replies:
scene8.line3.speaker=Paco Fiestas
scene8.line3.text=Why not? The best conversations always happen over pastries.
scene8.line4.speaker=Narrator
scene8.line4.text=Thus begins a new encounter: two cunning minds face to face, a politician accustomed to playing with the truth, and a detective who can discern lies even in silence.

# SCENE 8A
scene8a.line1.speaker=Poirot
scene8a.line1.text=Mr. Fiestas, I am curious whether you prefer the mysteries of ink and paper… or those offered by real life?
scene8a.line2.speaker=Paco Fiestas
scene8a.line2.text=Novels can be elegant, Poirot… but there is nothing more thrilling than an electoral scandal. I assure you, there are more twists and betrayals in a legislature than in any crime novel.
scene8a.line3.speaker=Poirot
scene8a.line3.text=Interesting… any real-life story that has marked you?
scene8a.line4.speaker=Paco Fiestas
scene8a.line4.text=During my first reelection in Nadiekistan, I received anonymous threats for introducing a dog-waste bag system. Do you know how many enemies one can make over such a small detail? Sometimes the mystery lies not in the crime, but in the motives.

# SCENE 8B
scene8b.line1.speaker=Poirot
scene8b.line1.text=Do you collect anything, Mayor? I’ve heard that many men of power have curious hobbies.
scene8b.line2.speaker=Paco Fiestas
scene8b.line2.text=Ah, yes. I am fascinated by antique objects. Each holds its own story… or legend. I have a small collection in my study.
scene8b.line3.speaker=Poirot
scene8b.line3.text=Any standout piece?
scene8b.line4.speaker=Paco Fiestas
scene8b.line4.text=A Templar dagger. It is said to have belonged to an inquisitor. The blade is nicked, as if it were used… and not precisely for cutting fruit. I never knew if it was authentic, but when I hold it, I feel watched. Curious, isn’t it?

# SCENE 9
scene9.line1.speaker=Narrator
scene9.line1.text=Wednesday dawns with unsettling news: Paco Fiestas has been found dead in his cabin, a strange red mark at the base of his neck.
scene9.line2.speaker=Narrator
scene9.line2.text=Poirot inspects the scene alongside Robin and María, while Anne watches, visibly disturbed, from a distance.
scene9.line3.speaker=Narrator
scene9.line3.text=Scattered around the cabin are several clues—each critical to unmasking the murderer.

# SCENE 10
scene10.line1.speaker=Poirot
scene10.line1.text=Robin, tell me, what do you observe in this scene?
scene10.line2.speaker=Robin
scene10.line2.text=The victim shows no obvious signs of struggle, sir. The attack was swift, precise, silent.
scene10.line3.speaker=Poirot
scene10.line3.text=Exactly. Notice the red mark at the base of his neck… does it remind you of anything?
scene10.line4.speaker=Robin
scene10.line4.text=A military technique, perhaps? Pressure on nerve points to immobilize?
scene10.line5.speaker=Poirot
scene10.line5.text=Precisely. Someone with very specific knowledge committed this crime. We must discover who has such skill… and why.

# SCENE 10A
scene10a.line1.speaker=Poirot
scene10a.line1.text=Robin, you observed the arrangement of objects in the cabin, didn’t you?
scene10a.line2.speaker=Robin
scene10a.line2.text=Yes, sir. Nothing seems forced or overturned. Everything is very methodical, as if the murderer planned every detail.
scene10a.line3.speaker=Poirot
scene10a.line3.text=That calm… only someone accustomed to control could act so. Let us proceed, mon ami.

# SCENE 10B
scene10b.line1.speaker=Poirot
scene10b.line1.text=Tell me, Robin, what do you think the motive might have been?
scene10b.line2.speaker=Robin
scene10b.line2.text=Perhaps revenge, sir. Paco Fiestas didn’t seem well-liked by everyone.
scene10b.line3.speaker=Poirot
scene10b.line3.text=Revenge? Or fear of a secret revealed? Remember: in crime, the smallest motives often trigger the greatest tragedies.

# SCENE 10C
scene10c.line1.speaker=Poirot
scene10c.line1.text=Miss María, you have forensic training. How do you explain a handkerchief bearing your initials found at the crime scene?
scene10c.line2.speaker=Maria
scene10c.line2.text=I don’t understand, monsieur Poirot. That handkerchief was in my pouch. Someone must have planted it!
scene10c.line3.speaker=Poirot
scene10c.line3.text=And what about your proximity to Mr. Fiestas during dinner?
scene10c.line4.speaker=Maria
scene10c.line4.text=It was a trivial conversation. Nothing that would justify such an accusation!

# SCENE 10N
scene10n.line1.speaker=Poirot
scene10n.line1.text=Anne, among your belongings we found your book detailing silent killing methods. Care to explain?
scene10n.line2.speaker=Anne
scene10n.line2.text=That is pure fiction! My novels are not crime manuals, monsieur Poirot!
scene10n.line3.speaker=Poirot
scene10n.line3.text=Fiction or not, the details match our scene disturbingly well.
scene10n.line4.speaker=Anne
scene10n.line4.text=I had nothing to do with this! I am but a writer trapped in someone else’s nightmare!

# SCENE 11
scene11.line1.speaker=Narrator
scene11.line1.text=After gathering all the clues, Poirot walks slowly through the lounge car as all passengers hold their breath.
scene11.line2.speaker=Poirot
scene11.line2.text=I have assembled all the necessary pieces. Paco Fiestas’s murder is no longer a mystery to me.
scene11.line3.speaker=Narrator
scene11.line3.text=A heavy silence falls over the room. The suspects glance at one another, uneasy.
scene11.line4.speaker=Poirot
scene11.line4.text=Truth, like daylight, cannot be hidden. The culprit is among us… and has left marks deeper than I anticipated.
scene11.line5.speaker=Narrator
scene11.line5.text=Poirot peers at the gathered company, ready to pronounce his final verdict.

# SCENE 11A
scene11a.line1.speaker=Poirot
scene11a.line1.text=Miss María, the evidence points squarely at you. The handkerchief, the sedative in the tea, the note…
scene11a.line2.speaker=Maria
scene11a.line2.text=No—this cannot be! I would never do such a thing! Someone planted that evidence to frame me.
scene11a.line3.speaker=Poirot
scene11a.line3.text=Then how do you explain your closeness to Mr. Fiestas on the night of the murder?
scene11a.line4.speaker=Maria
scene11a.line4.text=We merely spoke briefly! I had no motive to harm him! This is a dreadful mistake!

# SCENE 11B
scene11b.line1.speaker=Poirot
scene11b.line1.text=Anne, your detailed knowledge of silent killing methods and your book found at the scene raise suspicions.
scene11b.line2.speaker=Anne
scene11b.line2.text=That proves nothing! I am a novelist, not a murderer! Anyone could have left my book there.
scene11b.line3.speaker=Poirot
scene11b.line3.text=And yet your reaction seems to betray more than you intend to show…
scene11b.line4.speaker=Anne
scene11b.line4.text=I swear I had nothing to do with this! It’s a misunderstanding, an unfortunate coincidence!
